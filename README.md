# matlab_filtering

This repository contains the code to test all the filters on one image. Sometimes we have to try different filters on some images to check the result. So here's the code which implements 4 different filters on an image and displays its results. The filters are as follow
  1. Histogram Equalization
  2. Contrast Stretching
  3. Log Transform
  4. Histogram Specification
